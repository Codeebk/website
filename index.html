    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <div class="job">
        <h3>Senior Quality Engineer I - Everbridge</h3>
        <p>I curate datasets for model fine-tuning, conduct experiments with fine-tuning, and test advanced models such as GPT-4 and Llama. My scripts analyze tweets through engineered GPT-4 prompts to identify hazard events, aiding in synthetic data labeling for model training. I collaborate closely with ML engineers, showcasing my transition from Quality Engineering to AI and ML expertise.</p>
        <p>
            - Guide junior engineers as the Lead Quality Engineer on the Risk Intelligence Automation (RIA) and additional, small (3 person) Machine Learning team.
            - Lead fine-tuning and accuracy testing of language models for hazard event detection.
            - Establish communication channels between Risk Event analyst teams and engineers, opening up the opportunity for more quick iteration over problems and ideas.
            - Develop automated testing frameworks for microservices and event reporting UIs, speeding up processes and feedback.
            - Implement a comprehensive workflow to track quality metrics for the RIA engineering, Analyst, RIMC Engineering, Data Analytics, and ML teams- enhancing transparency, communication, and accountability.
            - Set up data pipelines from S3 > DBT > Snowflake > Tableau for 2 different large and constantly updated data sets- Risk Events, and Feed signals. This provides very valuable insight into productivity and hidden problems and bottlenecks. Allows more transparency of quality and progress across all teams mentioned above.
